# ‚òÄÔ∏è Solar Microgrid Placement Optimization using QUBO

This project models and solves the **optimal placement of solar microgrids** using the **Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO)** model. It uses synthetic data to simulate site attributes and leverages the `autoqubo` package to build and solve a QUBO formulation that balances cost, energy potential, and population coverage under budgetary and capacity constraints.

## üì¶ Features

* üîß Synthetic dataset generation for candidate sites  
* üß† Symbolic QUBO formulation using `autoqubo`  
* üéØ Multi-objective optimization:  
  - Minimize installation cost  
  - Maximize population coverage  
  - Maximize energy potential  
* üìà Constraints:
  - Total budget    
  - Minimum population served  
* ‚ö° Solves the QUBO and outputs an optimal site selection summary  

## üßÆ QUBO Formulation

The optimization problem is encoded as the following QUBO function:

```
Q(x) = ‚àë·µ¢ C·µ¢ x·µ¢ - Œ± ‚àë·µ¢ P·µ¢ x·µ¢ + Œ∏ (‚àë·µ¢ C·µ¢ x·µ¢ - B)¬≤ + Œº (‚àë·µ¢ x·µ¢ - K)¬≤ + Œª (M - ‚àë·µ¢ P·µ¢ x·µ¢)¬≤
```

**Where:**

* `x·µ¢ ‚àà {0, 1}` = 1 if site *i* is selected, 0 otherwise  
* `C·µ¢` = Installation cost at site *i*  
* `P·µ¢` = Population covered at site *i*  
* `B` = Budget cap  
* `K` = Maximum number of grids allowed  
* `M` = Minimum total population to be served  
* `Œ±`, `Œ∏`, `Œº`, `Œª` ‚Äî Weighting/penalty parameters

## üîß Installation

Ensure you have the latest version of Python and have installed the required packages:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas autoqubo
````

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è This project uses the [`autoqubo`](https://github.com/FujitsuResearch/autoqubo) library by [Fujitsu Research](https://github.com/FujitsuResearch), an automated QUBO generator that converts high-level Python-based optimization problems into equivalent QUBO representations.

## üöÄ Usage

Run the script with:

```bash
python qubo.py
```

The script will print the selected microgrid sites and a summary including total cost, population coverage, and energy capacity.

## üìä Sample Output

```
‚úÖ Selected Microgrid Sites:
    Site_ID     Installation_Cost_USD  Population_Coverage  Energy_Capacity_kWh_day  X_coord  Y_coord
    Site_3      16000                 1300                 1350.00                  0.34     0.47
    ...

üìä Summary:
   - Total Installation Cost: $XXX,XXX
   - Total Population Covered: XX,XXX people
   - Total Energy Capacity: XXXX kWh/day
   - Execution Time: X.XX seconds
```

## üìö Background

This tool simulates the strategic placement of **off-grid solar microgrids**‚Äîa vital approach to rural electrification in underserved regions. By formulating the site selection as a QUBO, the model can be solved using quantum or quantum-inspired solvers.
